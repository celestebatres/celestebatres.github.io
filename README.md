##Professional Profile

Hello! My name is Celeste Batres and I am currently studying Systems Engineering. I have a strong passion for technology and programming, specifically in web development. I am proficient in English and always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.

As a student, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science and programming principles. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills and learn more.

On GitHub, you can find some of my personal projects and contributions to open source projects. I am always open to collaborate and network with other developers, so feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my profile!
